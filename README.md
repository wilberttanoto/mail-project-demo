# How to run
1. Ensure you have the Python interpreter from the flask virtual environment
2. The sqlite database must also be created before the application can run, and the db_create.py script takes care of that.
3. $source flask-env/bin/activate
4. pip install -r requirements.txt to install all required packages
5. $python ./run.py
